## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep slate blue (#434A54) evokes professionalism and sophistication, appropriate for a portfolio.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F4F7), for a clean, modern feel. This desaturated color helps the primary stand out while avoiding harsh contrasts.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#877399). Slightly desaturated for elegance, this provides a gentle contrast without being distracting.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif). Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif). For longer texts, use 'Inter' as body and 'Space Grotesk' as header.
- Use simple, minimalist icons for navigation and contact information.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment.
- Use subtle fade-in and slide-in animations on scroll to enhance user experience.
